## Countdown timer

Animated timer counting down to a certain date/time. The timers are dynamic and will load to show the correct time at the time of open and animate 30 seconds of counting before looping back around. 

As well as setting a single fixed date/time, this can also be set dynamically by passing a date/time with a data flag (e.g. a daily trigger with a timer that's counting down to +30 days from deployment).
