## Add to Calendar

Functionality to create events that will be added to a customerâ€™s calendar with a single click. The event item can be set for a fixed date/time within the MI platform (e.g. for a sport fixture) or can be set dynamically if different date/times are needed per customer (e.g. the date they are able to swap device on Mobile). The event can also be populated with any title or description text required.

When this functionality has been used in campaigns, the CTR on calendar CTAs has averaged below 1%.
